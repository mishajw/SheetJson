# SheetJson

A music composing application that is dictated by JSON files.

See examples.json for examples of players.

## To Do

1) Create a FilterPlayer that takes a child, and when a key is pressed, start playing that child from the beginning, and stop when the key is released. It must also have some fade in and fade out function.

2) Implement time and pitch modification, or find a library that does.

3) Extend functionality of WaveFunction to be able to give values 0 to 1, -1 to 1, repeat 0 to 1 for whatever value passed in
