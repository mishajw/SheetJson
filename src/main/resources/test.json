/*

Types:
 - A-G(s|f)?: Plays a single tone
 - collection: Plays multiple children
 - riff-span: Plays children for certain times, sometimes overlapping
 - riff-duration: Each child has a duration, and they're played sequentially
 - tone: Plays a single tone

TBA types:
 - transformers: takes a child, transforms it in some way with given parameters
   - distortion
   - frequency changing

Thoughts:
 - Each `Player` should have `Some[LifeTime]`, where they possibly end at some point (in seconds)
 - Different types for each riff-* which redirect to a Riff where represented as riff-span
